# TODOs, NOTES, Whatevers

- use docker compose to deploy to an OVH machine

- put the branch name in the `-p` and create an nginx config to route
  '<branch-name-slug>.leukos.dev' to the install. will reuire some
  messing aroudn with scripts in the pipeline, but we'll get "per
  branch installs" which is good.
