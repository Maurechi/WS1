= API

The API is just a BfF, we're not trying to be a general PAI others could build clients on.

We expose hashids instead of the sequential interger primary keys
(probably not worth it, but I like the aesthetics of it). This makes
the sql code slightly more complicated (becuase know you need  around trip to the db to get the object values you want to return in the API reponse).

It's a price i'm willing to pay because I'm vain and I like hiding the fact that we have so few users now. I could also argue that since the code is a hash and not a sequential it distributes the keys for key based lookup for driectory tree creation better; which might true, but that's certainly not why i did it.
