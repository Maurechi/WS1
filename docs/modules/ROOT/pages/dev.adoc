= DIAAS

Data Infrastructe As A Service.

== local develoment

We had a docker-compose based setup for a while, but file system watcher were hard, enviorment variable management was hard, scripting and tooling so it was convneient to use was hard, it just wasn't worhth the complexity.

pyenv and npm provide very good isolated local environments, and tmux provides a more than good enough (for local dev) way to run all the services including restarting and debugging them as needed.
